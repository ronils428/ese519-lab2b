We check The I2C pins' waveforms on the oscilloscope. Just confirm that I2C communication is active (taking place) between the QT Py (KB2040 and sensor (APDS-9960). This can be done by flashinging the 'firefly' code on to the QT Py, which in ture is connected to the sensor (APDS-9960).
We connect the first probe to SCL (CLK or clock) while the associated black wire to ground of the microcontroller. Similarly, the second probe is connected to SDA while the associated black wire to ground.
